This project fits emission lines in the UV/Optical astronomical spectra.

The script creates a GUI to help users identify and fit conitnuum as well as the emission lines. 

The script further uses Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to identify the maximum number of lines required for an ideal multi-component gaussian best-fit.
